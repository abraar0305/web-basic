              "[['\\n\\nDonnie Brasco is a 1997 American crime drama film directed by Mike Newell, and starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp. Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, and Anne Heche appeared in supporting roles. The film, written by Paul Attanasio, is based on the 1988 nonfiction book Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia by Joseph D. Pistone, assisted by Richard Woodley.\\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone (Depp), an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia hitman, Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.\\n* * *\\nIn 1970s New York City, Lefty, an aging gangster in the Bonanno crime family, is introduced to a jewel thief named Donnie, who impresses Lefty by threatening a diamond dealer whom Donnie suspects of having sold Lefty a zirconia set ring, priced as a real diamond one. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the Mafia and introduces him to several made men, including Sonny, Nicky, and caporegime Sonny Red.\\nDonnie is revealed to be Joseph D. Pistone, an undercover FBI agent, whose wife, Maggie, is not fond of the his undercover position. After the Bonanno family’s street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes his position. As the crew runs a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, Pistone infiltrates the Mafia and collects more information for the FBI via wiretap recording.\\nFBI supervisor Dean Blandford takes an interest in the case, and asks Pistone to incorporate a Miami-based undercover FBI agent, Richie Gazzo, into the Bonanno’s operation. Though reluctant, Pistone convinces Sonny and the crew to meet Richie in Miami, where Donnie and Lefty plan to run Richie’s nightclub on their own, and attempt to impress Florida mob boss, Trafficante, with a yacht party. Sonny reaches there first, angering Lefty, especially for offering Donnie to run the club as an unofficial made man. However, they later reconcile when Lefty’s son nearly dies of a drug overdose.\\nOn its opening day, the nightclub is raided by Miami police on orders from Trafficante, who was colluding with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival caporegimes after calling a meeting. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal without Sonny’s knowledge and without making payments “up the chain.” Donnie helps with the clean up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red’s son, Bruno.\\nAt home, Pistone’s behavior increasingly becomes like that of the criminal he pretends to be. One last dispute between Donnie and his wife becomes physical.\\nWith increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. However, Bruno is tracked down and Lefty discovers that the yacht Donnie had previously arranged was federally owned. Outside the location where Bruno is hiding, Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but before either murder can be committed, FBI agents arrive and apprehend them.\\nFBI agents visit Sonny’s hangout, and reveal Donnie’s true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone in FBI uniform. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables and tells his girlfriend that if Donnie calls to tell him that “if it was going to be anyone, I’m glad it was him,” as he goes to his implied death. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, being awarded a $500 check and a medal.\\nThe end title cards state that the evidence collected by “Donnie Brasco” led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location, with a $500,000 open contract on his head.\\n* * *\\nYou’re not saying things that mean anything.\\nIt’s not even a debate.\\nIt’s a better automobile!\\nAin’t no way you can say to me a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.\\nA Lincoln is better.

              " ['\\n\\nA DE PALMA MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T LIKE DE PALMA MOVIES\\nby Pauline Kael\\nAl Pacino’s Tony Montana is small and mean. The slash of a scar that runs through one eyebrow and down across the cheekbone seems to go right to his soul; there’s something dead in his face—as if ordinary human emotions had rotted away, leaving nothing but greed and a scummy shrewdness. As the central character in the new Scarface, directed by Brian De Palma from a script by Oliver Stone, he scrambles up the rungs of the Miami drug world the way that Paul Muni, as an Italian immigrant, climbed to the top of the Chicago bootlegging business in the 1932 Scarface. Modelled on the career of Al Capone, the 1932 film, like the other prototypical gangster pictures—Little Caesar and The Public Enemy, both of 1931—was set during Prohibition. The basic story fits right into the early eighties: the new Scarface is a Cuban, one of an estimated ten thousand inmates of jails and mental institutions whom Castro, having his little joke, deported to the United States in 1980, when President Carter (briefly) opened the doors to Cuban refugees. Tony Montana boils with resentment because other people have a soft life, and more money than he has. “Me, I want what’s coming to me,” he says—”the world and everything in it.’’ He’s an angry, vindictive killer, and he sees America as the land of opportunity.\\nFor the first three-quarters of an hour, the film is garish and intense. With Giorgio Moroder’s synthesizer music pulsating and with shots of the arrival of the “Marielitos” (the Cubans who set out from Marie',\n",
              "  'l Harbor), it feels like the beginning of a new-style, post-Godfather gangster epic—hot and raw, like a spaghetti Western. The swaying movements of music and image suggest a developing delirium. In these lushly ominous early sequences, the-American immigration officers spot Tony for what he is, and they put him and his pal Manolo (Steven Bauer) in a detention camp. We see the sadistic murder that the two of them carry out in order to buy their freedom, and then the first drug deal that Tony handles, which turns into a bloody massacre. These two sequences are planned and edited with staccato, brutal efficiency; De Palma seems to be adapting his techniques to naked melodrama, chain-saw and all. (The massacre is awesome—a slapstick comedy of horrors which just goes streaking by.) And our first encounters with the other characters raise our expectations. Frank Lopez, the Hispanic-Jewish kingpin of the Miami drug trade, who takes a fancy to Tony, is like any number of movie producers: as played by Robert Loggia, he’s a big, beefy windbag who enjoys being expansive and handing out paternal advice. Frank’s bored girlfriend, Elvira, a Wasp junkie with silken blond hair and a mannequin’s cool, is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, a funny, sexy beauty who slinks across the screen—she’s the Platonic ideal of classy hooker. And Frank’s henchman, Omar, an anxious pockmarked creep who has a big laugh for his boss’s jokes, is played by the whirlwind F. Murray Abraham; he manages to look like a shark here, and every time he appears in a scene, its energy level jumps.\\nThe film is fin',\n",
              "  'e until it gets into the 1932 story. The original Scarface unfolded rapidly; the scenes went bambam fast. In this 1983 Scarface, the same scenes are played languorously, in stately, pseudo-Godfather style, as if something were going on in the characters—as if they had an interior life and were going to grow or change. Just when De Palma needs every trick he can come up with, he gives up on “style” and goes straight. The original had a core of wit, but Oliver Stone’s script just seems to touch the old bases, and after those showy early sequences De Palma tromps through the stock situations; nothing else he does has the rash brilliance of that Mack Sennett chain-saw sequence. His handling of the minor actors may be better than ever (Arnaldo Santana has a scene as Ernie—a flunky who expects to be killed and then isn’t—that any actor could be proud of), and he works in a lot of little zaps, and always provides you with something to look at. It’s the stuff up front that’s sluggish. When Howard Hawks, who directed the 1932 film, and Ben Hecht, who wrote the script, decided to give their Al Capone and his sister the incestuous passions of the Borgias, they were having a nose-thumbing good time. This new film lingers over Tony’s possessiveness about his sister, and is so obvious about it that the picture manages to make incest seem dated. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who plays the fiery sister, has a great camera face and is clearly raring to give a performance, but she’s stuck with scenes that refer back to the mores of 1932. When Tony’s mother (Miriam Colon)—a bone th',\n",
              "  'rown to the moralists—goes through the standard poor-but-proud speech, telling him how worthless he is, the episode has an echo-chamber effect. If the actress faltered in her lines, the audience could prompt her.\\nDe Palma may have felt that he could stretch himself by using a straightforward approach—something he has never been very good at. But what happens is simply that he’s stripped of his gifts. His originality doesn’t function on this crude, ritualized melodrama; he’s working against his own talent. In desperation, he seems to be trying to blast through the pulpy material to something primal, and it isn’t there. He keeps attempting to whip up big animalistic scenes, and then plods through them. And as the action rolls on, F. Murray Abraham is bumped off, and then Loggia (along with Harris Yulin, who turns up as a self-satisfied crooked narc and does perhaps the best work he’s ever done on the screen). And the piquant Michelle Pfeiffer—she hunches her beautiful skinny shoulder blades when she’s inhaling coke—doesn’t have enough disdainful, comic opportunities.\\nAfter a while, Pacino is a lump at the center of the movie. His Tony Montana has no bloom to lose, and he doesn’t suggest much in the way of potential: heights aren’t built into him. Nothing develops in Pacino’s performance. This is a two-hour-and-forty-nine-minute picture with a star whose imagination seems impaired. He wants to show us what an ignoramus this big-shot gangster is, and the role becomes an exercise in loathsomeness (on the order of De Niro’s performance in Raging Bull), without interna',\n",
              "  'l contradictions or shading. Pacino isn’t a lazy actor, and sometimes he comes up with invention that’s really inspired —like the way Tony, who’s all eyes for Elvira, bobs around her on the dance floor. It’s the only time he seems youthful: Elvira wriggles by herself, grinding her pelvis ever so slightly—this is her notion of sophisticated dancing—and he bounces about like a horny country bumpkin. (Pacino was also inspired in the contorted, ugly dancing he did in Cruising. ) But most of the time here he goes through the motions of impersonating a dynamo while looking as drained as he did at the end of The Godfather, Part II. He has no tension—his “dynamic” movements don’t connect to anything inside him. Then he gives up the fake energy, and this is supposed to stand for Tony’s disintegration. He’s doing the kind of Method acting in which the performer wants you to see that he’s living the part and expects you to be knocked out by his courage in running the gauntlet. Pacino is certainly willing to go all the way with Tony’s drunken and drugged-out loutishness. But he may be too comfortable with it; he’s sodden.\\nThere was a major difference between Paul Muni’s Tony in Scarface and both Edward G. Robinson’s Rico in Little Caesar and James Cagney’s Tommy Powers in The Public Enemy: Tony wasn’t likable. It was his jabbing, phallic drive—the sheer “I want” force of the man—that made him exciting to watch. Stone and De Palma have retained this idea; likability is left to Steven Bauer, as Tony’s loyal friend Manolo (the role played by George Raft in the 1932 version). B',\n",
              "  'auer, a bilingual Cuban-American in his mid-twenties who appeared in the eighteen-episode public-television series ¿Qué Pasa, USA? under the name Rocky Echevarria, brings the picture a nifty mixture of businesslike murderousness and lover-boy sweetness. You can hook in to his character, and you may experience a pang when Manolo is killed. But Pacino is not the darting, energetic gangster hero who scores and scores. He’s hollow from the start—he seems to have to act to look alive. And you don’t feel a thing when Tony is finished.\\nThis Scarface has the length of an epic but not the texture of an epic, and its dramatic arc is faulty: Tony is just starting to learn the ropes, and then, sated with wealth and dope, he’s moldy. He seems to get to the top by one quick coup. We need to see more of his rise and how he managed it—how he built his organization and won the loyalty of his men. And we need to see his triumph. We miss out on the frightening exhilaration of Tony’s winning his crown; there’s no satisfaction for Tony or for the audience. We don’t even get any of the gangster conspiracies that we might enjoy. The middle of the movie is missing. We get the aftermaths but not the capers. And Pacino seems to shrink with power; he looks as if he’s about to disappear in a puff of coke.\\nPacino has several scenes in which he’s practically buried in money —we are given to understand that it’s coming in so fast that it’s a joke. And he also has scenes in which he’s covered in cocaine: Tony dunks his face in it, or just shoves his snout in it. This, too, is a joke—the whole ',\n",
              "  'movie is a joke about consumerism (and capitalism). Tony gets everything he wanted—an estate with a tiger on the grounds, an enormous sunken tub for his bubble baths. The grandiose visual effects include a blimp with the words “The World Is Yours” spelled out in lights; it appears in the sky on the night that Tony disposes of Frank Lopez and lays claim to Elvira. The same words—they were the motif of the 1932 film, also—appear on the lamp (a globe of the world) that lights the Pompeian entranceway of the mansion that Tony and Elvira live in after they’re married. The joke is how shallow he is, how degraded. He’s a pig rooting around in money and cocaine, and, as things go wrong, he snorts more and more. (This could be a summary of how some movies are made now.)\\nProbably all this excess is intended to be satirical—snorting coke turns into a running gag. But the scenes are so shapeless that we don’t know at what point we’re meant to laugh. The ludicrousness that the moviemakers are showing us can’t be sorted out from the ludicrousness of the movie itself. When the quick-tempered Elvira, who has regarded Tony as filth since the first time she saw him, suddenly throws a drink at him, and says accusingly, “Can’t you see what we’ve become!,” her line is a howler. And when Elvira complains of the boringness of Tony’s constant use of a seven-letter obscenity it’s like a criticism of the picture. The obscenities here are boring; they’re used in the enervated way they were in Rumble Fish—the lines sound as if the actors were making them up. And in a picture with Ferdinand',\n",
              "  'o Scarfiotti as the visual consultant and such extravagant theatrical effects as rooms and terraces that are pastel abstractions, a painted mural of a tropical paradise on Frank Lopez’s office wall, and home furnishings that suggest Roman Empire Art Deco, the flat, stunted language seems almost campy, like the language in the Maria Montez-Jon Hall-Turhan Bey epics. What is a moviegoer supposed to be thinking about while listening to Elvira’s impassioned “We’re losers, not winners” or hearing Tony say of Elvira, “Her womb is polluted”? (He also comes up with some variant of “You touch my seester, I keel you.”)\\nThe movie turns funny through a curdled, unfunny blowsiness. Tony doesn’t even spit out his expletives anymore; he slurs them. Elvira accuses him of not being much of a lover, and he sprawls in his bubbles in his big tub watching TV and muttering, “I don’t need nobody.” This isn’t the usual La Dolce Vita, you’re-never-happy-when-you-get-what-you-want movie. Tony is progressively immobilized. He lolls in the circular tub, and the camera rises high above him—he’s a cigar butt in a bird’s-eye view of an ashtray. The camera has to move because he isn’t going to move. The dialogue doesn’t move the scenes forward, either, and the action slows to next to nothing.\\nTony is such a coked-up dullard that many of us in the audience— especially women—may lose all interest in him. His lassitude is our lassitude. But the moviemakers expect us to care about him because of their conception of his force. Near the start, Tony tells Frank Lopez that “the only thing that gives o',\n",
              "  'rders in this world is balls.” And Tony, as he keeps demonstrating by his brutality, has “steel in his balls.” That’s what separates him from the other gangsters: he’s fearless. This fearlessness—the cojones of a hit man—is the only explanation that the movie offers for Tony’s rise in the world. And because he isn’t afraid of anybody he dares to speak his mind. In a restaurant full of white-haired fat cats—a Wasp millionaires’ stronghold—he yells, “You don’t have the guts to be what you wanna be! You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers and say, ‘That’s the bad guy.’ ”\\nTony may sound almost passive; he may dribble saliva. But this is the film’s message (or rationalization): that Tony is an honestly brutal businessman—he isn’t a hypocrite like the Wasps. There’s even the suggestion that he’s better than they are because he isn’t afraid to do his own killing. (The film’s message is like a sociopathic moron’s interpretation of Robert Warshow’s thesis in his famous essay The Gangster as Tragic Hero.) The restaurant sequence is especially tinny, because the Establishment millionaires and their ladies are the usual Hollywood dress extras, and their polite, aghast expressions (and anonymous, helpful buzz) give them a stiff, Pop Art stuffed-dummy look. They’re in a time warp. This isn’t just a sloppy piece of filmmaking, though—it’s the only piece of rabble-rousing that I’ve ever seen in a De Palma movie. When Tony, the drunken, corrupted peasant, tells off the old rich, he appears to be speaking for the writer and the direc',\n",
              "  'tor. And from the film’s point of view he knows the truth about power and how it works. (It may be that Stone and De Palma got into these cheap distortions by using the movie business as their model for the world.)\\nThe picture is peddling macho primitivism and at the same time making it absurd. Tony’s sister does a creeping-hellcat seduction number on him, and he doesn’t respond. She empties a gun at him, and her bullets can’t kill him (or don’t, anyway); he gets more vital as he’s pumped full of lead. It takes men to shoot him down—in a rampaging, White Heat finale that involves an army of assassins and fills the screen with corpses, without generating much excitement.\\nAt the beginning, we’re led to expect that something terrible will happen, and what happens is that the director’s concentration seems to fall apart, and his energies are dispersed. Maybe in giving up his artistry De Palma was trying to identify with Pacino’s performance, and trying to persuade himself that the methods he was using here were more honest, more truthful than the way he’d worked on his other pictures. But Pacino’s Tony has nothing to reveal. Scarface is a long, druggy spectacle—manic yet exhausted, with De Palma entering into the derangement and trying to make something heroic out of Tony’s emptiness and debauchery. The director is doggedly persistent—compellingly so— but the whole feeling of the movie is limp. This may be the only action picture that turns into an allegory of impotence.\\nThe New Yorker, December 26, 1983\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\n\\n'],\n",

He reflects on his life leading up to where he is now, starting with his profession as a “house painter” – in other words, a hit-man.\\nIn the 1950’s, Frank, a World War II veteran, lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania working as a truck driver for a meat-packing company. He’s married to Mary (Aleksa Palladino) and has a daughter, Peggy (Lucy Gallina). In his work, he meets Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who advises him to get his truck fixed. When Frank asks Russell his name, he instead changes the subject before bidding Frank farewell.\\nFrank starts to rub elbows with local gangster Felix “Skinny Razor” DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale), providing him with some of the goods he carries. On a delivery, a client sees that Frank’s truck is empty, and his employers accuse him of stealing. Frank goes to lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), who helps Frank avoid legal repercussions by telling him to not give up the names of anybody that he was selling to. Later on, Bill formally introduces Frank to Russell, who is his cousin. Frank and Russell eat together, in which Frank discusses his time in the war, and how he was skilled at taking out enemy soldiers.\\nFrank is asked by a gangster called Whispers (Paul Herman) to take out Russell and his buddy Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). Frank doesn’t go through with it and instead brings this information to Russell and Angelo, and when Frank offers to return the money to Whispers, Angelo assures Frank that he won’t be needing it anymore.\\nOne afternoon, Frank goes home to see that Peggy is looking upset. Mary tells him that she knocked something over at the supermarket, and the store owner shoved her. Frank takes Peggy back to the store where he violently confronts the store owner, beating him and throwing him through the glass door before assaulting him in the street, in full view of Peggy and others walking by. This leads Peggy to become terrified of her father.\\n\\nRussell brings Frank in on his crime business as a hit-man, and he becomes well acquainted with a number of other gangsters (the onscreen text letting us know how all of them died horribly). During this time, Frank leaves Mary for a woman named Irene (Stephanie Kurtzuba), and they later have two other daughters, Connie and Dolores. He is eventually contacted by union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) after hearing about his work “painting houses”. Present Day Frank informs us that there is more to Jimmy that people don’t know other than his famed disappearance. Jimmy leads the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and is also in league with Russell and his gang. Jimmy also has an issue with Teamsters Vice President Anthony “Tony Pro” Provezano (Stephen Graham), as he has his own plans for his business. Frank becomes a bodyguard for Jimmy, and he also brings him along to meet the family. Peggy is most fond of Jimmy, even more so than she is of Russell, whom she knows is bad news.\\nJimmy and his Teamsters are staunchly against the Kennedys, which makes JFK’s election in 1960 hit a serious nerve for Jimmy. He rants to his men, and with Frank in the room, he thinks he is yelling at him too, but Jimmy assures Frank that he is not including him in the rant. In November 1963, after JFK is assassinated, Jimmy makes an insensitive comment to the press that Bobby Kennedy (Jack Huston), the former General Attorney, is now “just another lawyer.” Bobby later forms a squad to go after Jimmy, and he is eventually arrested for jury tampering. In Jimmy’s absence, the Teamsters is taken over by Frank “Fitz” Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba), who starts to use the group’s funds for himself or to make loans to the mob.\\nIn prison, Jimmy finds that Tony Pro is also there for extortion. Tony makes some attempt to hash out his issues with Jimmy, but they can’t reach an agreement, and it just leads to them getting into a brawl, which is broken up by guards and other inmates.\\nDuring a parade, a random mobster is shot dead in the middle of a crowd. Frank and Russell figure that the gunman was sent by Crazy Joe Gallo (Sebastian Maniscalco), who works with black gangsters to carry out his dirty work. As the name suggests, Joe is a hotheaded loose cannon. On his birthday, Frank and Russell accompany Joe to see Don Rickles (Jim Norton) perform, in which Joe almost snaps at Rickles for a joke. The mobsters agree that Joe is too much of a liability, so Frank is sent to take him out. Present Day Frank recalls picking specific guns to do the job. He catches Joe having dinner with his family at Umberto’s, whereupon he shoots at Joe before following him outside and finishing him off in the streets, then making a getaway.\\nIn 1971, Jimmy is released from prison after Richard Nixon gives him a presidential pardon, but he can’t go back to the Teamsters. Regardless, Jimmy makes an effort to rise back to power, which involves dumping on other Teamster leaders and disregarding crime family activities. Russell asks Frank to talk to Jimmy about his behavior, but Jimmy assures Frank that he can’t be harmed, or else anyone involved will go to jail.\\nWe then jump to 1975 where Frank, Russell, Irene, and Russell’s wife Carrie (Kathrine Narducci) are headed to a wedding for Bill’s daughter (the film had been cutting back and forth between this since the beginning). Russell tells Frank that it’s time for Jimmy to be taken care of. Frank arrives in Detroit after Jimmy is set to meet with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone (Patrick Gallo). Jimmy is surprised to see Frank with his foster son Chuckie O’Brien (Jesse Plemons) and fellow gangster Sally Bugs (Louis Cancelmi) after thinking Tony Pro stood him up. He is told that the meeting has been moved to another house where Tony and Russell are waiting for him. Frank takes Jimmy to the house, where Jimmy finds that it’s empty. Growing nervous and suspicious, Jimmy starts to walk out, only for Frank to shoot him twice in the back of the head. Frank leaves Jimmy’s body there, and it is later picked up by two other men who cremate his body.\\nJimmy’s disappearance becomes nationwide news. The Sheeran family watches at home, and after Frank offhandedly mentions he hasn’t called Jo (Jimmy’s wife) yet, Peggy (now played by Anna Paquin), realizes her father had something to do with whatever happened to Jimmy. Present Day Frank informs us that this is the day that Peggy stopped speaking to him.\\nFrank, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are arrested for suspicions of Jimmy’s disappearance, while guys like Sally Bugs are murdered. Tony Pro dies, while Frank spends one last moment with Russell in prison before Russell is wheeled away to the hospital, where he later dies.\\nFrank is later released from prison and is sent to the retirement home. He has been diagnosed with cancer and he can barely walk. He visits Peggy at her bank job, but she walks away the moment she sees Frank, even as he begs her to talk to him. His attempts to reconcile with his other daughters is also unsuccessful. With this, Frank simply prepares for his death. He picks out a green coffin and the spot where he wants to be buried.\\nAt the end of the night, Frank is taken to his room by an orderly. He asks the orderly to leave the door open, holding out hope that maybe someone in his family will still care to visit him.\\n\\nTranscript\\nWhen I was young, I thought house painters painted houses.\\nWhat did I know?\\nI was a working guy.\\nA business agent for Teamster Local 107 out of South Philly.\\nOne of a thousand working stiffs… until I wasn’t no more.\\nAnd then…\\nI started painting houses… myself.\\nIn this particular matter, the whole thing was built around the wedding.\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\nBill Bufalino’s daughter was getting married in Detroit.\\nBill was a Teamster lawyer, but more important, he was Russell Bufalino’s cousin.\\nNow, Russell didn’t want to fly, so I was gonna drive him to the wedding.\\nHe wanted to take care of some business along the way,\\nwhich in Russell’s case meant only one thing:\\nMoney… collecting it.\\nSo we’d drive.\\nHim and his wife Carrie and me and my wife Irene.\\nOr I call her Reenie.\\nI figured we would take 476 out of Philly, and then we go up to Pittston and pick up Russ, which is usually how we did it, and then Interstate 80 West through the rest of Pennsylvania, and then we’d go across Ohio, all the way to Toledo, and then we would go 75 North to Detroit.\\nIt was gonna take about three days with all the business breaks and cigarette stops, since Russell didn’t allow nobody to smoke in the car.\\nHe says Jimmy Blue Eyes and Meyer Lansky convinced him to stop smoking when they were getting kicked out of their casinos in Cuba and getting shot at by Castro.\\nI don’t know.

Thanks.\\nWhat are you doing here? I just told Bruno.\\nYou gotta go with Bruno.\\n– Yeah. Yeah, I’m on my way. – Yeah. Take care.\\nAnd when you did something for Russ,\\nyou did it yourself.\\nLike Russ used to say…\\nWhen I ask somebody to take care of something for me,\\nI expect them to take care of it themselves.\\nI don’t need two roads coming back to me.\\nWhen Anastasia got killed in the barbershop,\\nit was Russell they brought in to calm things down,\\nso that everybody wasn’t just going around killing everybody\\nand it could all get straightened out.\\nWe know what happened.\\nWe can’t change it. It is what it is.\\nPlease tell my friend I’m happy to help.\\nYou’d never know it by looking at this guy,\\nbut all roads led back to Russ.\\nWhere’s the money?\\n– He don’t have it. – He don’t have it?\\nHe said something, I don’t know, about his mother or…\\nStop.

              "  'hilosophy make sense to you?\\nSure does.\\nGood.\\nJimmy, he didn’t make me stay in his suite\\nbecause he liked me.\\nHe made me stay with him because he didn’t want me\\nregistering in my name at the hotel,\\nThis way, there was no proof I was even in Chicago.\\nCome on, Jimmy, you’re way behind.\\nNothing stops her.\\nAfter Chicago, Jimmy and / got close.\\nThe wives hit it off\\nAnd with Jimmy and Josephine’s kids\\nmostly grown up and out of the house,\\nthey got a kick out of our kids foo.\\nJimmy, Peggy, let’s get a picture.\\nYes. Come on.\\nEspecially Peggy.\\nShe and Jimmy, they fell for each other right away.\\nYou know what I like even better than getting my picture took?\\nWhat?\\nSurprise!\\nPeggy!\\n70 Peggy, Jimmy wasn’t like Russ,\\nor Skinny or even me.\\nSorry, everybody. This is just for Peggy and I.\\nFor one thing, Jimmy didn’t have a nickname\\nlike “The Razor,” or “The Hunchback,”\\nor “The Weasel,” or “Whispers.”\\nSo what happened to “Thank you”?\\nThank you!\\nAnd also, to her, he was helping people.\\nHe was helping them make more money, live better lives.\\nHe wasn’t stomping on somebody’s hand.\\n“If you have it, a truck brought it to you.”\\nThis is what Mr. Hoffa says.\\nHe’s the president of the Teamsters Union\\nwith over a million members.\\nThey all support him because they have steady jobs,\\ngreat pay and a pension for when they retire.\\nThe Teamster Pension Fund\\nhad eight billion dollars in it.\\nAnd Jimmy had complete control over every bit of It.\\nIsn’t this a beautiful presentation?\\nI mean, a bridge loan is really all I’m asking, Jimmy.\\nI’m not gonna piss away my members’ pension dough\\non something too risky.\\nThis is not a risk, Jimmy.\\nI got Minsky’s Follies.\\nI got the first topless act on the Strip.\\nI’m telling you, we’re booming in there.\\nI can’t get the drinks out…\\nJust asking for a golf course.\\nYou know you never lost a dime with me.\\nJimmy, we’d really just appreciate\\nwhatever you could do to help Jake along here.\\nOne-five is all I need for a completion bond.\\nOkay. Okay. Go to the bank.\\nThank you.\\nIt’s gonna be a big success.\\nThank you, Jimmy. You’re a prince.\\n– You’re a mensch. – Yeah, I’m a mensch.\\nAna, because of Mr. Hoffa,\\nworkers have medical insurance for when they get sick,\\nand know when they retire, they’re not going to go hungry.\\nThere was so much paperwork back then\\nthat Jimmy had to use an insurance company\\nthat was run by this kid, Allen Dorfman, to work out the loans.\\nNo, no, nothing for nothing.\\nNext time, try asking a little bit fucking nicer.\\nAnd? And? How’d it go?\\nIt was a little touch and go for a little bit.\\n– But at the end, fine. – Good.\\n/t was Russ who got Jimmy\\nto give guys like Gottlieb the loans,\\nand, you know, he would get like 70% of that.\\nOr whatever, you know. Maybe more.\\nListen, you tell Marteduzzo from me that I appreciate it.\\nAnd everybody’s gonna appreciate it.\\n– It’s a good thing. – Okay. I’ll do that.\\nBack then, you couldn’t go to regular banks\\nbecause the money was for gambling.\\nGod’s truth, that’s what it was. I’m serious. You couldn’t\\nSo the Mob, what did they do?\\nThey went to the Teamsters for the money.\\nIt was the Teamsters that stepped in\\nand lent the money that built Las Vegas.\\n– This is the mahogany… – Don’t, Billy.\\n– Don’t touch the stuff. – I won’t.\\n– Just go where you gotta go. – Okay.\\nThere was more business than anybody could handle.\\nSo Jimmy had to shove some of the deals off onto his wife Jo,\\nwho had no idea she had 22%\\nof a Florida land deal called “Sun Valley,”\\nsome charter fishing boats,\\nand a ski lodge with its own mountain.\\nOne of Jimmy’s clients was Sam “Momo” Giancana,\\nwho was friends with the Kennedys from back when Jack’s father\\nmade his fortune with the Italians\\nas a bootlegger during Prohibition.\\nMomo, Sinatra hung out together with the Kennedys.\\nMomo and Kennedy,\\nbelieve it or not, even had the same girlfriend.\\nTogether. At the same time.\\nTalk about crazy.\\nSo it was easy for the Mob to help Joe Kennedy\\nget his son elected president. That was easy.\\nThey just punched up the vote a little\\nto make sure that he won in Illinois.\\nIn exchange for that,\\nthe new president was supposedly gonna get Castro out of Cuba\\nSO our guys could get their casinos back,\\nand race tracks, and shrimp boats,\\nand everything else that they had,\\nand owned down there from Havana back.\\nBut that… that didn’t happen.\\nThe Italians wanted Kennedy the Irishman for president,\\nand that’s what they got.\\nGet used to it, because we’re gonna be seeing it 24/7.\\nSon of a bitch!\\nGoddamn Kennedys.\\nI’m looking at the goddamn Kennedys.\\nJimmy, the kids. Language.\\nWhat difference does it make?\\nI mean, they gotta learn sooner or later.\\nWe’re going to war with these people.\\nWar!\\nIf I said it once, I said it a thousand times,\\nI don’t care they’re Irish.\\nI don’t care they’re Catholic.\\nIf there’s one person you can’t trust in this life,\\nit’s millionaires’ kids.\\nYou’re right, Jimmy.\\nEspecially that little son of a bitch.\\nAre you saying you don’t remember\\ndoing any favors for Johnny Dio,\\nor you don’t remember the conversation?\\nI’m saying, to the best of my recollection,\\nI must recall on my memory,\\nI cannot remember.\\nThen where did this $20,000 come from?\\nIndividuals.\\nWhich individuals, Mr. Hoffa?\\nOffhand, that particular amount of money I borrowed,\\nI don’t know at this particular moment.\\nBut the record of my loans, which I requested, I have,\\nand out of all the moneys I loaned\\nduring this period of time I went into these ventures.\\nThose goddamn Kennedys,\\nthey get what they want!\\nJimmy. Jimmy, the kids.\\nHim and all the bullshit problems\\n– he put me through already. – Jimmy.\\nI gotta go. You don’t expect me to look at this.\\nNo, I don’t.\\n– Whoa! – For guys like Russ,\\nit couldn’t have been better.\\nI mean, Russ,\\nyeah, he did his part for getting Kennedy elected,\\nthat’s for sure.\\nWhat are you doing? I told you to put it…\\nI told you to put them on every pole.

What is that?\\nWho does he think he is, Erroll Flynn?\\nHe went against everything and everybody.\\nJust didn’t give a shit.\\nAnd, growing up, he kidnapped his own bosses.\\nI don’t know how he got away with that.\\nYou don’t get away with that. You do that, you die.\\nThat simple.\\nWhen he went away to the can,\\nhe recruited black guys instead of his own kind.\\nAnd when he got out, nobody knew what he was doing,\\nor who he was doing with it.\\nWe didn’t know what the hell was going on.
